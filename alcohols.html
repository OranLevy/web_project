            Tequila is a distilled alcoholic beverage from the white liquor family, produced exclusively in specific
            areas in five states in Mexico, mainly around the city of Tequila, in the state of Jalisco in Mexico. The
            tequila is produced from the core of a desert agave bush, called blue agave and common in Mexico: in order
            to call a distilled drink tequila it must meet a detailed set of regulations such as the drink must be
            produced in Mexico, in the area of the city of Tequila. It must be produced from at least 51% blue agave,
            the quality tequilas are made from 40% agave. The bottle must have an official seal, containing the number
            of the distillery, the alcohol percentage in the drink must range from 35% to 49% alcohol.

          <p class="alcohol_content">
            Gin is considered a difficult drink to drink, due to its very high alcoholic strength and very dry taste, so
            it is very rare to see people drinking it without mixing it with any other liquid, unlike other spirits such
            as tequila and vodka. Gin today is produced in different ways from a wide range of herbal ingredients,
            giving rise to a number of distinct styles and brands. After juniper, gin tends to be flavoured with
            botanical/herbal, spice, floral or fruit flavours or often a combination. It is commonly consumed mixed with
            tonic water in a gin and tonic. Gin is also often used as a base spirit to produce flavoured, gin-based
            liqueurs, for example sloe gin, traditionally produced by the addition of fruit, flavourings and sugar.

            Most of the rum is produced in the Caribbean Sea and the mouth of the Demerara River in South America. Other
            countries where it is produced are Australia, India and the former French colonies in the Indian Ocean. Rum
            has religious and cultural importance in the countries of the Caribbean basin and South America. The use of
            rum is common in the religious tradition of the Santeria religion and other Caribbean religions. In
            addition, rum has a long-standing connection to the British navy whose sailors, including pirates and slave
            traders, would drink it neat or with added water. The rum was one of the main trade products of the "New
            World" of America supplied to the "Old World" of Europe, and on the background of the trade and the
            production of rum, events took place, such as the American Revolution.

            Vodka is a clear distilled alcoholic beverage. Different varieties originated in Poland, Russia, and Sweden.
            Vodka is composed mainly of water and ethanol but sometimes with traces of impurities and flavourings.
            Traditionally, it is made by distilling liquid from fermented cereal grains, and potatoes since introduced
            in Europe in the 1700's. Some modern brands use fruits, honey, or maple sap as the base. Since the 1890s,
            standard vodkas have been 40% alcohol by volume. The European Union has established a minimum alcohol
            content of 37.5% for vodka. Vodka in the United States must have a minimum alcohol content of 40%.

          <p class="alcohol_content">
            Whiskey is a common distilled spirit, produced by the still fermentation of grains and the distillation of
            the fermentation liquid. The product of the distillation, which is commonly called in English New-Make, is
            aged in oak barrels, usually charred on the inside. The minimum percentage of alcohol in whiskey is 40%
            alcohol by volume. The whiskey can be served in a variety of ways and is used in a large number of
            cocktails, but when it is drunk neat it is usually served in an Old Fashioned glass sometimes with ice
            cubes. In the first decade of the 21st century, they also began to serve in a Glencairn whiskey glass, a
            glass designed to lead the aroma of the whiskey to the drinker's nose and is therefore considered the best
            glass to drink whiskey in.

            Campari has been produced in Milan since 1862, the year in which it was first prepared by Gaspera Campari,
            the owner of the cafe "Caffe Camprino" in the city. The exact recipe for making the liqueur has never
            changed and is a family secret of the Campari family. The success of the drink led to the establishment of
            the Campari Group, the manufacturer of the drink. According to the group's data, 86 types of plant roots,
            herbs, spices and fruits are used in the preparation of the drink.
