        Gin is considered a difficult drink to drink, due to its very high alcoholic strength and very dry taste, so it
        is very rare to see people drinking it without mixing it with any other liquid, unlike other spirits such as
        tequila and vodka.

        Campari has been produced in Milan since 1862, the year in which it was first prepared by Gaspera Campari, the
        owner of the cafe "Caffe Camprino" in the city. The exact recipe for making the liqueur has never changed and is
        a family secret of the Campari family. The success of the drink led to the establishment of the Campari Group,
        the manufacturer of the drink. According to the group's data, 86 types of plant roots, herbs, spices and fruits
        are used in the preparation of the drink.

        Most of the rum is produced in the Caribbean Sea and the mouth of the Demerara River in South America. Other
        countries where it is produced are Australia, India and the former French colonies in the Indian Ocean. Rum has
        religious and cultural importance in the countries of the Caribbean basin and South America. The use of rum is
        common in the religious tradition of the Santeria religion and other Caribbean religions. In addition, rum has a
        long-standing connection to the British navy whose sailors, including pirates and slave traders, would drink it
        neat or with added water. The rum was one of the main trade products of the "New World" of America supplied to
        the "Old World" of Europe, and on the background of the trade and the production of rum, events took place, such
        as the American Revolution.

      <p class="card__description">
        Whiskey is a common distilled spirit, produced by the still fermentation of grains and the distillation of the
        fermentation liquid. The product of the distillation, which is commonly called in English New-Make, is aged in
        oak barrels, usually charred on the inside. The minimum percentage of alcohol in whiskey is 40% alcohol by
        volume. The whiskey can be served in a variety of ways and is used in a large number of cocktails, but when it
        is drunk neat it is usually served in an Old Fashioned glass sometimes with ice cubes. In the first decade of
        the 21st century, they also began to serve in a Glencairn whiskey glass, a glass designed to lead the aroma of
        the whiskey to the drinker's nose and is therefore considered the best glass to drink whiskey in.
