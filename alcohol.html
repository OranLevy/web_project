            Tequila is a distilled alcoholic beverage from the white liquor family, produced exclusively in specific
            areas in five states in Mexico, mainly around the city of Tequila, in the state of Jalisco in Mexico. The
            tequila is produced from the core of a desert agave bush, called blue agave and common in Mexico: in order
            to call a distilled drink tequila it must meet a detailed set of regulations such as the drink must be
            produced in Mexico, in the area of the city of Tequila. It must be produced from at least 51% blue agave,
            the quality tequilas are made from 40% agave. The bottle must have an official seal, containing the number
            of the distillery, the alcohol percentage in the drink must range from 35% to 49% alcohol.

            Gin is considered a difficult drink to drink, due to its very high alcoholic strength and very dry taste,
            so
            it is very rare to see people drinking it without mixing it with any other liquid, unlike other spirits
            such
            as tequila and vodka. Gin today is produced in different ways from a wide range of herbal ingredients,
            giving rise to a number of distinct styles and brands. After juniper, gin tends to be flavoured with
            botanical/herbal, spice, floral or fruit flavours or often a combination. It is commonly consumed mixed
            with
            tonic water in a gin and tonic. Gin is also often used as a base spirit to produce flavoured, gin-based
            liqueurs, for example sloe gin, traditionally produced by the addition of fruit, flavourings and sugar.

            Rum
            has religious and cultural importance in the countries of the Caribbean basin and South America. The use
            of
            rum is common in the religious tradition of the Santeria religion and other Caribbean religions. In
            addition, rum has a long-standing connection to the British navy whose sailors, including pirates and
            slave
            traders, would drink it neat or with added water. The rum was one of the main trade products of the "New
            World" of America supplied to the "Old World" of Europe, and on the background of the trade and the
            production of rum, events took place, such as the American Revolution.

            Vodka is a clear distilled alcoholic beverage. Different varieties originated in Poland, Russia, and
            Sweden.
            Vodka is composed mainly of water and ethanol but sometimes with traces of impurities and flavourings.
            Traditionally, it is made by distilling liquid from fermented cereal grains, and potatoes since introduced
            in Europe in the 1700's. Some modern brands use fruits, honey, or maple sap as the base. Since the 1890s,
            standard vodkas have been 40% alcohol by volume. The European Union has established a minimum alcohol
            content of 37.5% for vodka. Vodka in the United States must have a minimum alcohol content of 40%.

            Whiskey is a common distilled spirit, produced by the still fermentation of grains and the distillation of
            the fermentation liquid. The product of the distillation, which is commonly called in English New-Make, is
            aged in oak barrels, usually charred on the inside. The minimum percentage of alcohol in whiskey is 40%
            alcohol by volume. The whiskey can be served in a variety of ways and is used in a large number of
            cocktails, but when it is drunk neat it is usually served in an Old Fashioned glass sometimes with ice
            cubes. In the first decade of the 21st century, they also began to serve in a Glencairn whiskey glass, a
            glass designed to lead the aroma of the whiskey to the drinker's nose and is therefore considered the best
            glass to drink whiskey in.

            Brandy is a liquor produced by distilling wine. Brandy generally contains 35â€“60% alcohol by volume and is
            typically consumed as an after-dinner digestif. Some brandies are aged in wooden casks. Others are
            coloured
            with caramel colouring to imitate the effect of ageing, and some are produced using a combination of
            ageing
            and colouring. Varieties of wine brandy can be found across the winemaking world. In a broader sense, the
            term brandy also denotes liquors obtained from the distillation of pomace, or mash or wine of any other
            fruit. These products are also called eau de vie (which translates to "water of life").

            Cognac is a variety of brandy named after the commune of Cognac, France. It is produced in the surrounding
            wine-growing region in the departments of Charente and Charente-Maritime. Cognac production falls under
            French appellation d'origine contrÃ´lÃ©e designation, with production methods and naming required to meet
            certain legal requirements. Among the specified grapes, Ugni blanc, known locally as Saint-Ã‰milion, is
            most
            widely used. The brandy must be twice distilled in copper pot stills and aged at least two years in French
            oak barrels from Limousin or TronÃ§ais. Cognac matures in the same way as whiskies and wines barrel-age,
            and
            most cognacs spend considerably longer "on the wood" than the minimum legal requirement.

            produced by the Barbieri company, based in Padua, but is now produced by the Campari Group. Aperol was
            originally created in 1919 by Luigi and Silvio Barbieri, but it did not become successful until after
            World
            War II. Although it tastes and smells much like Campari, Aperol has an alcohol content of 11%â€”less than
            half
            that of Campari. They have the same sugar content, and Aperol is less bitter in taste. Campari is also
            much
            darker in color.

            the Campari Group, the manufacturer of the drink. According to the group's data, 86 types of plant roots,
            herbs, spices and fruits are used in the preparation of the drink.

            illegally
            in Sudan, see Araqi. Arak or araq is a distilled Levantine spirit of the anise drinks family. It is
            translucent and unsweetened. Arak is traditionally made of only two ingredients, grapes and aniseed.
            Aniseeds are the seeds of the anise plant, and when crushed, their oil provides arak with a slight
            licorice
            taste. The word arak comes from Arabic araq. Arak is not to be confused with the similarly named liquor,
            arrack, which in some cases, such as in Indonesia-especially Bali-also goes by the name arak. Another
            similar-sounding word is aragh, which in Armenia, Iran, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Iraq is the colloquial
            name
            of vodka, and not an aniseed-flavored drink.

            like pastis, sambuca, raki and arak. Ouzo is usually mixed with water, becoming cloudy white, sometimes
            with
            a faint blue tinge, and served with ice cubes in a small glass. Ouzo can also be drunk straight from a
            shot
            glass. Ouzo is often served with a small plate of a variety of appetizers called mezes, usually small
            fresh
            fish, fries, olives, and feta cheese. Ouzo can be described to have a similar taste to absinthe which is
            licorice-like, but smoother.
